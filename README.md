[https://bgp-data.net](https://bgp-data.net/?ref=github) â€” BGP Data Collection and Analytics Service

BGPDATA helps researchers and network operators gain insights into their networks by providing a scalable and reliable way to analyze and inspect historical and live BGP data from [Route Views](https://www.routeviews.org/) and [RIPE NCC RIS](https://ris.ripe.net/).

## Data Flow
We collect both historical and live BGP data from [Route Views](https://www.routeviews.org/) and [RIPE NCC RIS](https://ris.ripe.net/) collectors to provide comprehensive insights.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bgpdata/bgpdata.git
cd bgpdata
```

### Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

-   `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the application image.
-   `docker-compose.yaml`: Docker Compose file to set up the application and OpenBMP services.
-   `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for the application.
-   `app.py`: The application code.
-   `Makefile`: Makefile for building and starting the services.

### Build and Start the Services

To build and start BGPDATA, run the following command in the project directory:

```sh
make up
```

This command will:

1. Build the Docker image for the various services.
2. Start the services and initialize the Databases.
3. Serve a user interface at [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)
4. And begin the data collection process from [Route Views](https://www.routeviews.org/) and [RIPE NCC RIS](https://ris.ripe.net/) collectors.

### Accessing the Application

Once the services are up and running, you can access the user interface at [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080).
We also provide a REST API at [`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/`](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/) for programmatic access to the data (coming soon).
As well as a Grafana dashboard at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to visualize the data and performance metrics (internal only).
